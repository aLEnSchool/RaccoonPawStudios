Mrs. Rosa, could you show me the contents of your bag? #portrait:tom
I don't have to show you anything! You're not even a real detective. #portrait:rosa
(They don't understand...) #portrait:tom
(I can never be a real detective.)
(No matter how hard I try, no matter how many cases I solve. My past is too dark...)
(Oh Benny, I wish you were here with me.)
(Even a glimpse of your face would make me feel better.)
Ma'am, surely there;s no reason to be so defensive. Unless you're hiding something.
Oh, Rosa, honey. It's okay. We have nothing to hide... snooze. #portrait:john
