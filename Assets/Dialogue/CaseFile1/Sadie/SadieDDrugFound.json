Haha. ","#","^portrait:sadie","/#","\n","^Depends. Do you think you should be? ","#","^portrait:tom","/#","\n","^Oh, um. Of course not. ","#","^portrait:sadie","/#","\n","^Unless it's for being too cute.","\n","^... ","#","^portrait:tom","/#","\n","^It's not. ","#","^portrait:tom","/#","\n","^... ","#","^portrait:sadie","/#","\n","^Ms. Sweets, how long have you been selling mercury? ","#","^portrait:tom","/#","\n","^I--what?! Mercury? ","#","^portrait:sadie","/#","\n","^Yes, Ms. Sweets. I know you've got a stash in your locker. ","#","^portrait:tom","/#","\n","^But you promised not to look inside my locker! ","#","^portrait:sadie","/#","\n","^So, you admit it then? ","#","^portrait:tom","/#","\n","^No! No, it's not mine. ","#","^portrait:sadie","/#","\n","^Whose is it then? Ms. Chef Frances? ","#","^portrait:tom","/#","\n","^No! She would never. She always told me... ","#","^portrait:sadie","/#","\n","^...","\n","^...Yes? What did she tell you? ","#","^portrait:tom","/#","\n","^Frannie would never sell mercury. ","#","^portrait:sadie","/#","\n","^Well, if it wasn't you, it must've been her. ","#","^portrait:tom","/#","\n","^Who else has access to your locker code?","\n","^Maybe someone else could've guessed it-- ","#","^portrait:sadie","/#","\n","^It's such a shame. ","#","^portrait:tom","/#","\n","^Frannie's Diner is so well loved in this area, and for the chef to have been caught selling mercury!","\n","^The place will have to shut down.","\n","^Stop! Fine, it was me! I was selling the mercury. ","#","^portrait:sadie","/#","\n","^Oh, really? ","#","^portrait:tom","/#","\n","^How do I know you're not covering for Ms. Chef Frances?","\n","^I can give you all the details she wouldn't know. ","#","^portrait:sadie","/#","\n","^I sold mercury to Mr. Bowler: three vials every Fridays.","\n","^After he finished his drink, he'd head to the alley through the hallway, and we'd make the swap.","\n","^The swap? ","#","^portrait:tom","/#","\n","^Mercury for money, Mr. Trilby. Do keep up. ","#","^portrait:sadie","/#","\n","^Right. You needed the extra cash? ","#","^portrait:tom","/#","\n","^Of course.","#","^portrait:sadie","/#","\n","^The diner business on this side of town doesn't pay much.","\n","^He was also the Minister of Health, you know, so he'd let us pass health inspections.","\n","^I see. ","#","^portrait:tom","/#","\n","^So...It's Monday, not Friday. Why was he here?","\n","^Oh, he was here nearly every day. He liked the sticky smoothies. ","#","^portrait:sadie","/#","\n","^...Alright, but what happened? ","#","^portrait:tom","/#","\n","^Did he approach you, asking for more mercury?","\n","^Perhaps he threatened to expose you, and you dealt with him?","\n","^What? Dealt with him? ","#","^portrait:sadie","/#","\n","^Set him on fire? ","#","^portrait:tom","/#","\n","^Oh my Fabric! You think I killed him? ","#","^portrait:sadie","/#","\n","^You're quite a likely suspect, Ms. Sweets. ","#","^portrait:tom","/#","\n","^Ha! ","#","^portrait:sadie","/#","\n","^Selling mercury doesn't make me a killer, Mr. Trilby.","\n","^I understand that quite well, but you did have the motive and the opportunity for it. ","#","^portrait:tom","/#","\n","^I don't know what to tell you, Mr. Trilby. I didn't kill him. ","#","^portrait:sadie","/#","\n","^Where were you at the time of the murder? ","#","^portrait:tom","/#","\n","^I was doing my job. I believe any of the customers can confirm that. ","#","^portrait:sadie","/#","\n","^Thank you for your time, Ms. Sweets.
