Well, John. I think you did it. I'm giving you the chace to come clean.
What?
John, I know you weren't asleep. Who sleeps through brunch?
I'm a tired guy, detective. You know, we have--
A hundreds of kids, yeah. It's why you would need the cash. You got paid to do, and framed your wife. All clues lead to the two of you. Was it a team job? Tell me, John. Tell me!
Detective... Have you thought of getting some sleep yourself.
(John was right. I am incredibly tired. I haven't gotten good sleep in years.)
(JOHN DID NOT DO IT.)
