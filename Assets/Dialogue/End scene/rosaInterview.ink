Well, Rosa. I think you did it. I'm giving you the chace to come clean.
I didn't do it!
Rosa, tell me where the money came from.
I told you--
Stop the babbling. You're broke, too many kids to count, and clearly in need of help. There's no one to account for you in the diner. And the letter in the bathroom matches your handwriting and paper from your bag. At least tell me why you did it, Rosa.
I-- ... I-I... You don't understand. You just don't. They keep coming. The kids keep coming. We didn't have enough after the fifth. We have fifteen now! Why do we keep getting kids at our doorsteps. They keep choosing us. I've begged to the High Council to stop. I'd do anything. Anything! And-and they told me. They told me if I did... If I... Then they'd stop. And they'd take care of us. I had no choice. Please. I had no choice. 
Oh, Rosa...
(ROSA DID IT)
