Case 01: 
Monday, November 14, XX42. 09.00 a.m.
Dear Field Note Journal,
As I entered my office, I sat down, cigarette on my brim, and opened the file.
The victim, Mr. Bowler, was an official servant to the High Fibrous Council. His title: “Minister of Health and Food Safety.” 
In the alley of Frannie's Diner, Mr. Bowler was found dead by the cook, Chef Frances. It may have been ruled as gang activity, but there were five potential assailants in close proximity of the crime scene.
Suspicious, suspicious I find it all. So, I will do what I do best: take in all the information given and investigate the scene of the crime. 
No more time for delay. 
Who killed you, Mr. Bowler? 
P.I. Tom Trilby
